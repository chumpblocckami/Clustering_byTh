# Clustering_byTh
Example of a cluster method that uses Euclidean Distance as a way to estimate community.

All the word were made using GOOGLE COLAB, so references might change.

I'll update all the files generated from my example, but remember that the points are random generated, so every solutions is unique. 

Feel free to send me feedback and everything, i will update the repository with other (and more accurate) implementation.
